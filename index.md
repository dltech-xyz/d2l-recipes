# Machine Learning Recipes

Assume you are going to use machine learning to solve a particular task, such as
predicting the unit sales of goods, evaluating if a transaction is fraud, locating
some objects in images or building a chatbot. You could start with finding code examples
that solve a similar task to yours. You may realize soon that the examples you find on
Github, Kaggle or Medium are fragmented. Some use toolkits you are not familiar with,
some only provide a partial solution instead of an end-to-end with data preprocessing,
model training and deployment. Some even cannot run due to the rapid changing of
machine learning tools.

This project provides recipes to a wide range of machine learning applications.
These recipes can be used as starting template for your machine learning projects.
In order to do so, we try to

1. cover a diverse set of machine learning applications
1. provide multiple recipes for each applications, ranging from automl-based
   solution for simplicity to solutions for the best accuracy or the fast inference speed
1. be framework/toolkits neutral
1. offer end-to-end solutions so you can use them in production
1. provide concise code implementations so you can easily copy-and-paste.

If you are a reader of [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/), which teaches models,
you will find the focus of this project is on applying models to solve problems.
It means we will not teaching you particular models, but explain the applications and why we
use these solutions.

Here are the applications organized by the input data types. You can click the link
to check the recipes to solve a particular application.
